    "# Product $\\sigma$-Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is part of a bigger series on probabilistic machine learning and aids in understanding product $\\sigma$-algebras.\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, you will understand...\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Definition of the $\\sigma$-Algebra\n",
    "- Why these concepts matter, especially for robotics\n",
    "- How to apply them using the package   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since studying concepts like the $\\sigma$-Algebra is dry, I want to motivate you on why this matters and you should take the time to think about the $\\sigma$-Algebra and specially the Product $\\sigma$-Algebra:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foundations of probability theory**: $\\sigma$-algebras are the building blocks for defining probability in a rigorous way. By understanding them, you gain a deeper understanding of how probabilities are assigned to events.\n",
    "- **Working with complex events**:  In real-world scenarios, events can be intricate. Sigma algebras allow you to describe not just simple events but also unions, intersections, and complements of these events, giving you a powerful tool to analyze probabilities of more complex situations.\n",
    "- **Connection to advanced math**: Sigma algebras bridge the gap between set theory and advanced mathematical concepts like measure theory and integration. Studying them opens doors to these powerful tools used in various scientific fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in robotics, it is also important since:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reasoning with uncertainty**: Robots often operate in environments with uncertainty. $\\sigma$ algebras provide a mathematical foundation to represent uncertain events and reason about the probability of different events happening (like sensor readings or obstacles appearing).\n",
    "- **Decision making under probability**:  Many robotic tasks involve making decisions based on probabilities. By understanding $\\sigma$-algebras, you can build algorithms that consider the chance of different outcomes and choose the action with the highest probability of success.\n",
    "- **Planning and control under uncertainty**:  Planning robot actions often requires considering various possibilities. $\\sigma$-algebras allow you to create probabilistic models of the environment, enabling robots to plan and control their movements while accounting for uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has shown that events that are described by independent constraints (rules) are most likely the only events where probability estimation is tractable.\n",
    "Spaces that are constructed by independent constraints are called product spaces.\n",
    "Understanding the shape of such events is a key competence to building (new) tractable probabilistic models.\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will work with some visualizations of said events, to get a better understanding of their shape, behavior and math."
